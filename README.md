# 🏗 System Architecture

```
Frontend (React + Vite)
        ↓
Backend API (Node.js + Express)
        ↓
Database (MongoDB)
        ↓
File Storage (Google Drive)
```

### Why Google Drive?

Instead of storing large files in the database:

- MongoDB stores **resource metadata**
- Google Drive stores **actual files**

This keeps the system **lightweight and scalable**.

1. User logs in using their **NIT KKR email ID**
2. Backend verifies the email and generates a **JWT token**
3. The token is stored in an **HTTP-only cookie**
4. On refresh, the frontend verifies the session using `/api/users/me`
